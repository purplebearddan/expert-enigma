## Intros

### JavaScript

JavaScript is a high-level programming language that is widely used to create interactive and dynamic web pages. It is a client-side scripting language, which means that it is executed on the user's browser, rather than on the server. JavaScript was originally designed to add interactivity to HTML pages, but it has evolved to become a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of applications, including web and mobile app development, game development, and server-side programming.

### Primitive Data Types in JavaScript

In JavaScript, there are five primitive data types: strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and generic objects. These data types are used to represent different types of values in a program. Strings are used to represent text, while numbers are used to represent numeric values, which can be either integers or floating-point numbers. Booleans are used to represent true/false values. Arrays are used to store collections of values, while generic objects are used to store key-value pairs.

### Strings in JavaScript

Strings are one of the primitive data types in JavaScript. They are used to represent text and are enclosed in single or double quotes. Strings can be concatenated using the + operator, and individual characters can be accessed using bracket notation. Strings also have a number of built-in methods that can be used to manipulate and transform them.

### Numbers (Integers/Floats) in JavaScript

Numbers are another primitive data type in JavaScript. They are used to represent numeric values and can be either integers or floating-point numbers. Numbers can be manipulated using mathematical operators like +, -, *, and /, and they also have a number of built-in methods that can be used to perform mathematical operations on them.

### Booleans (true/false) in JavaScript

Booleans are a primitive data type in JavaScript that are used to represent true/false values. They are often used in conditional statements and logical expressions to control the flow of a program. Booleans can be created using the true and false keywords, and they also have a number of built-in methods that can be used to perform logical operations on them.

### Arrays (Lists) in JavaScript

Arrays are a data structure in JavaScript that are used to store collections of values. They can be created using square brackets and can contain any combination of data types, including strings, numbers, and other arrays. Arrays have a number of built-in methods that can be used to manipulate and transform them, including methods for adding and removing elements, sorting, and searching.

### Generic Objects (Labelled Lists) in JavaScript

Generic objects are another data structure in JavaScript that are used to store key-value pairs. They are often used to represent complex data structures, such as JSON data. Objects can be created using curly braces and can contain any combination of data types as values, as well as keys to access those values. Objects also have a number of built-in methods that can be used to manipulate and transform them.

### Dot Notation in JavaScript

Dot notation is a syntax used in JavaScript to access properties and methods of an object. It involves using a dot (.) followed by the name of the property or method to access it. Dot notation is often used with built-in objects and methods in JavaScript, such as `Math.PI` or `console.log()`. It can also be used to access properties and methods of custom objects and functions.

### Built-in Methods and Properties in JavaScript

JavaScript provides a number of built-in methods and properties that can be used to perform common tasks and operations. These include methods for working with strings, numbers, arrays, and objects, as well as properties for accessing information about the browser and the environment in which the script is running. Built-in methods and properties are often used in conjunction with dot notation to access and manipulate data in a program.
